# this is the order used to determine whether to show a repository in the list or not.
# if a repo doesn't meet any of these, it isn't shown. Otherwise, we use these in the order
# specified to determine if we show a repo, and if so, what we show about it
repo_criteria:
  - homepage # if present, use the Repository Homepage URL (at the top of the repo page, next to the description) as the link
  - github_pages # otherwise, if present, use the repo's GitHub Pages URL as the link
  - readme: 100 # for any repo with a README >= 100 bytes, link to the repo itself
  - description # for any repo with a description set, link to the repo itself
  - all # link to ALL repos, even if they don't have any of the above
